## Description

Are you tired of scribbling your schedule in notebooks and then forgetting which class to attend?
Do you want to become more organized and enhance your academic performance? Our app is here to help you!

It is essential to stay organized and keep track of all assignments and classes in order to obtain
the greatest accomplishments in your college life. This application was designed for students
who have a recurring week schedule and automatically displays the schedule for the following
weeks. You just need to fill up your schedule once, and the app will take care of the rest!

Features -

- ClassLink is unlike any other calendar since it is designed from the outset to work for
your educational life, with support for week rotation plans. Add your classes and see
them in a visually appealing, readily recognizable week view.

- **FOR KIIT CSE BRANCH STUDENTS IN THEIR FIRST OR SECOND YEAR**: When you
create an account with your KIIT email address, you will be given the option of selecting
a section. Once you've chosen your section, you may upload the complete week's
schedule, which will sync with all users in that section. This means that students in that
section who sign up for the app won't have to add their schedules separately.

- If there is a need to change or update the schedule for your section, you can easily do
that from the edit/add section. The changes you made will reflect on all the users from
that section.

- As an additional failsafe, you can also see the name of the person who made the most
recent changes to your section's timetable.

- If a student from the aforementioned category chooses to log in to the app using their
personal email address, they will not be able to use the sync feature.

- ALL OTHER STUDENTS: You can log in to the app with either your KIIT email address
or your personal email address and make your own schedule, albeit you won't be able to
pick your section or sync it with the other students from your section.

- ClassLink seamlessly syncs your data between devices, allowing you to use the app even when you're not connected to the internet.
